	<p>Dear fellow Dinosaur lovers,<br>
	<pre>  This is the list of my favorite Dinos. </pre></p>
	
	<h1> Tyrannosaurus Rex </h1>
	<p> Tyrannosaurus rex, commonly known as T. rex, was a massive, bipedal carnivore that 	lived during the Late Cretaceous period. This iconic dinosaur, the namesake of the 	tyrannosaurid family, was renowned for its powerful jaws, strong bite force, and fearsome 	appearance. T. rex was one of the largest known land carnivores, reaching lengths of up 	to 40 feet and weighing up to 8.8 tons. Its size, combined with its powerful bite and 	keen sense of smell, made it a formidable predator. </p>

	<h1> Triceratops </h1>
	<p> Triceratops, meaning "three-horned face," were large, herbivorous ceratopsian 	dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 68 to 66 million 	years ago. They are easily recognized by their three horns and a large, bony frill 	extending from the back of their skull. These dinosaurs were one of the last known non-	avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. </p>
